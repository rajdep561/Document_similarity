### cosine similarity

**Cosine similarity**  is a  [measure of similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_of_similarity "Measure of similarity")  between two non-zero vectors of an  [inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space")  that measures the  [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine")  of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval  (0,π]  [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian"). It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90° relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. The cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in  {\displaystyle [0,1]}![[0,1]](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/738f7d23bb2d9642bab520020873cccbef49768d). The name derives from the term "direction cosine": in this case,  [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector")  are maximally "similar" if they're parallel and maximally "dissimilar" if they're  [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal")  (perpendicular). This is analogous to the cosine, which is unity (maximum value) when the segments subtend a zero angle and zero (uncorrelated) when the segments are perpendicular.
